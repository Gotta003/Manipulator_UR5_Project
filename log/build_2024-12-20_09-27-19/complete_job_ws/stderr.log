[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmove_ws.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "move_ws", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "move_ws" with any
  of the following names:

    move_wsConfig.cmake
    move_ws-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "move_ws" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "move_ws_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "move_ws" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
